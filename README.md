#### Challenge: Calculate Border Crossings Code Challenge: 

#### Solution Implementation Details:

Border_crossing_analysis.py:

3 Classes:
 - Data: models the data in a row.
 - Key: models the data which we have to aggregate / group by.
 - Result : models what we have to print per row (key + values computed).


2 Major Functions:
- compute_sums: computes the "value"
- compute_avgs: computes the cumulative averages


#### How to run this program:

Input and output file paths are already specified in the code to be "...."

run.sh runs the python file witout any command line inputs.

ru_tests.sh runs each test in test filder and compares output generated by the program to ouptut/report.csv.


#### ===================================
#### Problem: Calculate Border Crossings: 


#### Input Dataset:
For this challenge, you will be given an input file, Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv, that will reside in the top-most input directory of your repository.

The file contains data of the form:

Port Name,State,Port Code,Border,Date,Measure,Value,Location
Derby Line,Vermont,209,US-Canada Border,03/01/2019 12:00:00 AM,Truck Containers Full,6483,POINT (-72.09944 45.005)
Norton,Vermont,211,US-Canada Border,03/01/2019 12:00:00 AM,Trains,19,POINT (-71.79528000000002 45.01)
Calexico,California,2503,US-Mexico Border,03/01/2019 12:00:00 AM,Pedestrians,346158,POINT (-115.49806000000001 32.67889)

See the notes from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for more information on each field.

For the purposes of this challenge, you'll want to pay attention to the following fields:

Border: Designates what border was crossed
Date: Timestamp indicating month and year of crossing
Measure: Indicates means, or type, of crossing being measured (e.g., vehicle, equipment, passenger or pedestrian)
Value: Number of crossings


#### Expected Output:
Using the input file, you must write a program to

#### 1. Sum the total number of crossings (Value) of each type of vehicle or equipment, or passengers or pedestrians, that crossed the border that month, regardless of what port was used.

Group results by vehicle and equipment type, passengers or pedestrian and aggeregate ports 
Keys: border, measure, month


#### 2. Calculate the running monthly average of total crossings, rounded to the nearest whole number, for that combination of Border and Measure, or means of crossing.
Your program must write the requested output data to a file named report.csv in the top-most output directory of your repository.

The lines should be sorted in descending order by

Comparator : (x, y)  < 

Date
Value (or number of crossings)
Measure
Border
The column, Average, is for the running monthly average of total crossings for that border and means of crossing in all previous months.

For example, given the above input file, the correct output file, report.csv would be:

Border,             Date,                   Measure,                Value,  Average
US-Mexico Border,   03/01/2019 12:00:00 AM, Pedestrians,            346158, 114487
US-Canada Border,   03/01/2019 12:00:00 AM, Truck Containers Full,  6483,   0
US-Canada Border,   03/01/2019 12:00:00 AM, Trains,                 19,     0
US-Mexico Border,   02/01/2019 12:00:00 AM, Pedestrians,            172163, 56810
US-Canada Border,   02/01/2019 12:00:00 AM, Truck Containers Empty, 1319,   0
US-Mexico Border,   01/01/2019 12:00:00 AM, Pedestrians,            56810,  0


#### Note: Moving Average Example: 

In this example, to calculate the Average for the first line (i.e., running monthly average of total pedestrians crossing the US-Mexico Border in all of the months preceding March), 
you'd take the average sum of total number of US-Mexico pedestrian crossings in:

February 156,891 + 15,272 = 172,163 
+
January 56,810, and round it to the nearest whole number round
(228,973/2) = 114,487
